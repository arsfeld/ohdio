This is a web application written using the Phoenix web framework.

## Project guidelines

- Use `mix precommit` alias when you are done with all changes and fix any pending issues
- Use the already included and available `:req` (`Req`) library for HTTP requests, **avoid** `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, and `:httpc`. Req is included by default and is the preferred HTTP client for Phoenix apps

### Docker Compose helper

This project includes a `./dc` helper script for Docker Compose operations and running commands inside the Phoenix container.

**Docker Compose commands:**

```bash
# Start services
./dc up -d              # Start in detached mode
./dc up                 # Start with logs attached

# Stop services
./dc down               # Stop and remove containers
./dc stop               # Stop without removing
./dc restart            # Restart services

# View status and logs
./dc ps                 # List containers
./dc logs -f            # Follow logs
./dc logs phoenix       # Logs for specific service
```

**Container exec commands:**

```bash
# Run mix commands
./dc mix test
./dc mix ecto.migrate
./dc mix deps.get

# Start an IEx shell
./dc iex -S mix

# Run precommit checks
./dc mix precommit

# Get a bash shell
./dc bash

# Any other command
./dc mix phx.routes
```

The script intelligently routes commands: Docker Compose commands (up, down, logs, etc.) are passed through to `docker compose`, while other commands are executed inside the phoenix container via `docker compose exec phoenix`.

### Phoenix v1.8 guidelines

- **Always** begin your LiveView templates with `<Layouts.app flash={@flash} ...>` which wraps all inner content
- The `MyAppWeb.Layouts` module is aliased in the `my_app_web.ex` file, so you can use it without needing to alias it again
- Anytime you run into errors with no `current_scope` assign:
  - You failed to follow the Authenticated Routes guidelines, or you failed to pass `current_scope` to `<Layouts.app>`
  - **Always** fix the `current_scope` error by moving your routes to the proper `live_session` and ensure you pass `current_scope` as needed
- Phoenix v1.8 moved the `<.flash_group>` component to the `Layouts` module. You are **forbidden** from calling `<.flash_group>` outside of the `layouts.ex` module
- Out of the box, `core_components.ex` imports an `<.icon name="hero-x-mark" class="w-5 h-5"/>` component for for hero icons. **Always** use the `<.icon>` component for icons, **never** use `Heroicons` modules or similar
- **Always** use the imported `<.input>` component for form inputs from `core_components.ex` when available. `<.input>` is imported and using it will will save steps and prevent errors
- If you override the default input classes (`<.input class="myclass px-2 py-1 rounded-lg">)`) class with your own values, no default classes are inherited, so your
custom classes must fully style the input

### JS and CSS guidelines

- **Use Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS rules** to create polished, responsive, and visually stunning interfaces.
- Tailwindcss v4 **no longer needs a tailwind.config.js** and uses a new import syntax in `app.css`:

      @import "tailwindcss" source(none);
      @source "../css";
      @source "../js";
      @source "../../lib/my_app_web";

- **Always use and maintain this import syntax** in the app.css file for projects generated with `phx.new`
- **Never** use `@apply` when writing raw css
- **Always** use daisyUI components for UI elements (buttons, cards, modals, forms, etc.) to maintain consistency and leverage pre-built, accessible components
- Out of the box **only the app.js and app.css bundles are supported**
  - You cannot reference an external vendor'd script `src` or link `href` in the layouts
  - You must import the vendor deps into app.js and app.css to use them
  - **Never write inline <script>custom js</script> tags within templates**

### UI/UX & design guidelines

- **Produce world-class UI designs** with a focus on usability, aesthetics, and modern design principles
- Implement **subtle micro-interactions** (e.g., button hover effects, and smooth transitions)
- Ensure **clean typography, spacing, and layout balance** for a refined, premium look
- Focus on **delightful details** like hover effects, loading states, and smooth page transitions

## Elixir guidelines

- Elixir lists **do not support index based access via the access syntax**

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      mylist[i]

  Instead, **always** use `Enum.at`, pattern matching, or `List` for index based list access, ie:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      Enum.at(mylist, i)

- Elixir variables are immutable, but can be rebound, so for block expressions like `if`, `case`, `cond`, etc
  you *must* bind the result of the expression to a variable if you want to use it and you CANNOT rebind the result inside the expression, ie:

      # INVALID: we are rebinding inside the `if` and the result never gets assigned
      if connected?(socket) do
        socket = assign(socket, :val, val)
      end

      # VALID: we rebind the result of the `if` to a new variable
      socket =
        if connected?(socket) do
          assign(socket, :val, val)
        end

- **Never** nest multiple modules in the same file as it can cause cyclic dependencies and compilation errors
- **Never** use map access syntax (`changeset[:field]`) on structs as they do not implement the Access behaviour by default. For regular structs, you **must** access the fields directly, such as `my_struct.field` or use higher level APIs that are available on the struct if they exist, `Ecto.Changeset.get_field/2` for changesets
- Elixir's standard library has everything necessary for date and time manipulation. Familiarize yourself with the common `Time`, `Date`, `DateTime`, and `Calendar` interfaces by accessing their documentation as necessary. **Never** install additional dependencies unless asked or for date/time parsing (which you can use the `date_time_parser` package)
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Predicate function names should not start with `is_` and should end in a question mark. Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards
- Elixir's builtin OTP primitives like `DynamicSupervisor` and `Registry`, require names in the child spec, such as `{DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.MyDynamicSup}`, then you can use `DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MyApp.MyDynamicSup, child_spec)`
- Use `Task.async_stream(collection, callback, options)` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure. The majority of times you will want to pass `timeout: :infinity` as option

## Mix guidelines

- Read the docs and options before using tasks (by using `mix help task_name`)
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mix test --failed`
- `mix deps.clean --all` is **almost never needed**. **Avoid** using it unless you have good reason
<!-- phoenix:elixir-end -->

<!-- phoenix:phoenix-start -->
## Phoenix guidelines

- Remember Phoenix router `scope` blocks include an optional alias which is prefixed for all routes within the scope. **Always** be mindful of this when creating routes within a scope to avoid duplicate module prefixes.

- You **never** need to create your own `alias` for route definitions! The `scope` provides the alias, ie:

      scope "/admin", AppWeb.Admin do
        pipe_through :browser

        live "/users", UserLive, :index
      end

  the UserLive route would point to the `AppWeb.Admin.UserLive` module

- `Phoenix.View` no longer is needed or included with Phoenix, don't use it
<!-- phoenix:phoenix-end -->

<!-- phoenix:ecto-start -->
## Ecto Guidelines

- **Always** preload Ecto associations in queries when they'll be accessed in templates, ie a message that needs to reference the `message.user.email`
- Remember `import Ecto.Query` and other supporting modules when you write `seeds.exs`
- `Ecto.Schema` fields always use the `:string` type, even for `:text`, columns, ie: `field :name, :string`
- `Ecto.Changeset.validate_number/2` **DOES NOT SUPPORT the `:allow_nil` option**. By default, Ecto validations only run if a change for the given field exists and the change value is not nil, so such as option is never needed
- You **must** use `Ecto.Changeset.get_field(changeset, :field)` to access changeset fields
- Fields which are set programatically, such as `user_id`, must not be listed in `cast` calls or similar for security purposes. Instead they must be explicitly set when creating the struct
<!-- phoenix:ecto-end -->

<!-- phoenix:html-start -->
## Phoenix HTML guidelines

- Phoenix templates **always** use `~H` or .html.heex files (known as HEEx), **never** use `~E`
- **Always** use the imported `Phoenix.Component.form/1` and `Phoenix.Component.inputs_for/1` function to build forms. **Never** use `Phoenix.HTML.form_for` or `Phoenix.HTML.inputs_for` as they are outdated
- When building forms **always** use the already imported `Phoenix.Component.to_form/2` (`assign(socket, form: to_form(...))` and `<.form for={@form} id="msg-form">`), then access those forms in the template via `@form[:field]`
- **Always** add unique DOM IDs to key elements (like forms, buttons, etc) when writing templates, these IDs can later be used in tests (`<.form for={@form} id="product-form">`)
- For "app wide" template imports, you can import/alias into the `my_app_web.ex`'s `html_helpers` block, so they will be available to all LiveViews, LiveComponent's, and all modules that do `use MyAppWeb, :html` (replace "my_app" by the actual app name)

- Elixir supports `if/else` but **does NOT support `if/else if` or `if/elsif`. **Never use `else if` or `elseif` in Elixir**, **always** use `cond` or `case` for multiple conditionals.

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      <%= if condition do %>
        ...
      <% else if other_condition %>
        ...
      <% end %>

  Instead **always** do this:

      <%= cond do %>
        <% condition -> %>
          ...
        <% condition2 -> %>
          ...
        <% true -> %>
          ...
      <% end %>

- HEEx require special tag annotation if you want to insert literal curly's like `{` or `}`. If you want to show a textual code snippet on the page in a `<pre>` or `<code>` block you *must* annotate the parent tag with `phx-no-curly-interpolation`:

      <code phx-no-curly-interpolation>
        let obj = {key: "val"}
      </code>

  Within `phx-no-curly-interpolation` annotated tags, you can use `{` and `}` without escaping them, and dynamic Elixir expressions can still be used with `<%= ... %>` syntax

- HEEx class attrs support lists, but you must **always** use list `[...]` syntax. You can use the class list syntax to conditionally add classes, **always do this for multiple class values**:

      <a class={[
        "px-2 text-white",
        @some_flag && "py-5",
        if(@other_condition, do: "border-red-500", else: "border-blue-100"),
        ...
      ]}>Text</a>

  and **always** wrap `if`'s inside `{...}` expressions with parens, like done above (`if(@other_condition, do: "...", else: "...")`)

  and **never** do this, since it's invalid (note the missing `[` and `]`):

      <a class={
        "px-2 text-white",
        @some_flag && "py-5"
      }> ...
      => Raises compile syntax error on invalid HEEx attr syntax

- **Never** use `<% Enum.each %>` or non-for comprehensions for generating template content, instead **always** use `<%= for item <- @collection do %>`
- HEEx HTML comments use `<%!-- comment --%>`. **Always** use the HEEx HTML comment syntax for template comments (`<%!-- comment --%>`)
- HEEx allows interpolation via `{...}` and `<%= ... %>`, but the `<%= %>` **only** works within tag bodies. **Always** use the `{...}` syntax for interpolation within tag attributes, and for interpolation of values within tag bodies. **Always** interpolate block constructs (if, cond, case, for) within tag bodies using `<%= ... %>`.

  **Always** do this:

      <div id={@id}>
        {@my_assign}
        <%= if @some_block_condition do %>
          {@another_assign}
        <% end %>
      </div>

  and **Never** do this – the program will terminate with a syntax error:

      <%!-- THIS IS INVALID NEVER EVER DO THIS --%>
      <div id="<%= @invalid_interpolation %>">
        {if @invalid_block_construct do}
        {end}
      </div>
<!-- phoenix:html-end -->

<!-- phoenix:liveview-start -->
## Phoenix LiveView guidelines

- **Never** use the deprecated `live_redirect` and `live_patch` functions, instead **always** use the `<.link navigate={href}>` and  `<.link patch={href}>` in templates, and `push_navigate` and `push_patch` functions LiveViews
- **Avoid LiveComponent's** unless you have a strong, specific need for them
- LiveViews should be named like `AppWeb.WeatherLive`, with a `Live` suffix. When you go to add LiveView routes to the router, the default `:browser` scope is **already aliased** with the `AppWeb` module, so you can just do `live "/weather", WeatherLive`
- Remember anytime you use `phx-hook="MyHook"` and that js hook manages its own DOM, you **must** also set the `phx-update="ignore"` attribute
- **Never** write embedded `<script>` tags in HEEx. Instead always write your scripts and hooks in the `assets/js` directory and integrate them with the `assets/js/app.js` file

### LiveView streams

- **Always** use LiveView streams for collections for assigning regular lists to avoid memory ballooning and runtime termination with the following operations:
  - basic append of N items - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg])`
  - resetting stream with new items - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg], reset: true)` (e.g. for filtering items)
  - prepend to stream - `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg], at: -1)`
  - deleting items - `stream_delete(socket, :messages, msg)`

- When using the `stream/3` interfaces in the LiveView, the LiveView template must 1) always set `phx-update="stream"` on the parent element, with a DOM id on the parent element like `id="messages"` and 2) consume the `@streams.stream_name` collection and use the id as the DOM id for each child. For a call like `stream(socket, :messages, [new_msg])` in the LiveView, the template would be:

      <div id="messages" phx-update="stream">
        <div :for={{id, msg} <- @streams.messages} id={id}>
          {msg.text}
        </div>
      </div>

- LiveView streams are *not* enumerable, so you cannot use `Enum.filter/2` or `Enum.reject/2` on them. Instead, if you want to filter, prune, or refresh a list of items on the UI, you **must refetch the data and re-stream the entire stream collection, passing reset: true**:

      def handle_event("filter", %{"filter" => filter}, socket) do
        # re-fetch the messages based on the filter
        messages = list_messages(filter)

        {:noreply,
        socket
        |> assign(:messages_empty?, messages == [])
        # reset the stream with the new messages
        |> stream(:messages, messages, reset: true)}
      end

- LiveView streams *do not support counting or empty states*. If you need to display a count, you must track it using a separate assign. For empty states, you can use Tailwind classes:

      <div id="tasks" phx-update="stream">
        <div class="hidden only:block">No tasks yet</div>
        <div :for={{id, task} <- @stream.tasks} id={id}>
          {task.name}
        </div>
      </div>

  The above only works if the empty state is the only HTML block alongside the stream for-comprehension.

- **Never** use the deprecated `phx-update="append"` or `phx-update="prepend"` for collections

### LiveView tests

- `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` module and `LazyHTML` (included) for making your assertions
- Form tests are driven by `Phoenix.LiveViewTest`'s `render_submit/2` and `render_change/2` functions
- Come up with a step-by-step test plan that splits major test cases into small, isolated files. You may start with simpler tests that verify content exists, gradually add interaction tests
- **Always reference the key element IDs you added in the LiveView templates in your tests** for `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` functions like `element/2`, `has_element/2`, selectors, etc
- **Never** tests again raw HTML, **always** use `element/2`, `has_element/2`, and similar: `assert has_element?(view, "#my-form")`
- Instead of relying on testing text content, which can change, favor testing for the presence of key elements
- Focus on testing outcomes rather than implementation details
- Be aware that `Phoenix.Component` functions like `<.form>` might produce different HTML than expected. Test against the output HTML structure, not your mental model of what you expect it to be
- When facing test failures with element selectors, add debug statements to print the actual HTML, but use `LazyHTML` selectors to limit the output, ie:

      html = render(view)
      document = LazyHTML.from_fragment(html)
      matches = LazyHTML.filter(document, "your-complex-selector")
      IO.inspect(matches, label: "Matches")

### Form handling

#### Creating a form from params

If you want to create a form based on `handle_event` params:

    def handle_event("submitted", params, socket) do
      {:noreply, assign(socket, form: to_form(params))}
    end

When you pass a map to `to_form/1`, it assumes said map contains the form params, which are expected to have string keys.

You can also specify a name to nest the params:

    def handle_event("submitted", %{"user" => user_params}, socket) do
      {:noreply, assign(socket, form: to_form(user_params, as: :user))}
    end

#### Creating a form from changesets

When using changesets, the underlying data, form params, and errors are retrieved from it. The `:as` option is automatically computed too. E.g. if you have a user schema:

    defmodule MyApp.Users.User do
      use Ecto.Schema
      ...
    end

And then you create a changeset that you pass to `to_form`:

    %MyApp.Users.User{}
    |> Ecto.Changeset.change()
    |> to_form()

Once the form is submitted, the params will be available under `%{"user" => user_params}`.

In the template, the form form assign can be passed to the `<.form>` function component:

    <.form for={@form} id="todo-form" phx-change="validate" phx-submit="save">
      <.input field={@form[:field]} type="text" />
    </.form>

Always give the form an explicit, unique DOM ID, like `id="todo-form"`.

#### Avoiding form errors

**Always** use a form assigned via `to_form/2` in the LiveView, and the `<.input>` component in the template. In the template **always access forms this**:

    <%!-- ALWAYS do this (valid) --%>
    <.form for={@form} id="my-form">
      <.input field={@form[:field]} type="text" />
    </.form>

And **never** do this:

    <%!-- NEVER do this (invalid) --%>
    <.form for={@changeset} id="my-form">
      <.input field={@changeset[:field]} type="text" />
    </.form>

- You are FORBIDDEN from accessing the changeset in the template as it will cause errors
- **Never** use `<.form let={f} ...>` in the template, instead **always use `<.form for={@form} ...>`**, then drive all form references from the form assign as in `@form[:field]`. The UI should **always** be driven by a `to_form/2` assigned in the LiveView module that is derived from a changeset

<!-- BACKLOG.MD GUIDELINES START -->
# Instructions for the usage of Backlog.md CLI Tool

## Backlog.md: Comprehensive Project Management Tool via CLI

### Assistant Objective

Efficiently manage all project tasks, status, and documentation using the Backlog.md CLI, ensuring all project metadata
remains fully synchronized and up-to-date.

### Core Capabilities

- ✅ **Task Management**: Create, edit, assign, prioritize, and track tasks with full metadata
- ✅ **Search**: Fuzzy search across tasks, documents, and decisions with `backlog search`
- ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**: Granular control with add/remove/check/uncheck by index
- ✅ **Board Visualization**: Terminal-based Kanban board (`backlog board`) and web UI (`backlog browser`)
- ✅ **Git Integration**: Automatic tracking of task states across branches
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Task relationships and subtask hierarchies
- ✅ **Documentation & Decisions**: Structured docs and architectural decision records
- ✅ **Export & Reporting**: Generate markdown reports and board snapshots
- ✅ **AI-Optimized**: `--plain` flag provides clean text output for AI processing

### Why This Matters to You (AI Agent)

1. **Comprehensive system** - Full project management capabilities through CLI
2. **The CLI is the interface** - All operations go through `backlog` commands
3. **Unified interaction model** - You can use CLI for both reading (`backlog task 1 --plain`) and writing (
   `backlog task edit 1`)
4. **Metadata stays synchronized** - The CLI handles all the complex relationships

### Key Understanding

- **Tasks** live in `backlog/tasks/` as `task-<id> - <title>.md` files
- **You interact via CLI only**: `backlog task create`, `backlog task edit`, etc.
- **Use `--plain` flag** for AI-friendly output when viewing/listing
- **Never bypass the CLI** - It handles Git, metadata, file naming, and relationships

---

# ⚠️ CRITICAL: NEVER EDIT TASK FILES DIRECTLY. Edit Only via CLI

**ALL task operations MUST use the Backlog.md CLI commands**

- ✅ **DO**: Use `backlog task edit` and other CLI commands
- ✅ **DO**: Use `backlog task create` to create new tasks
- ✅ **DO**: Use `backlog task edit <id> --check-ac <index>` to mark acceptance criteria
- ❌ **DON'T**: Edit markdown files directly
- ❌ **DON'T**: Manually change checkboxes in files
- ❌ **DON'T**: Add or modify text in task files without using CLI

**Why?** Direct file editing breaks metadata synchronization, Git tracking, and task relationships.

---

## 1. Source of Truth & File Structure

### 📖 **UNDERSTANDING** (What you'll see when reading)

- Markdown task files live under **`backlog/tasks/`** (drafts under **`backlog/drafts/`**)
- Files are named: `task-<id> - <title>.md` (e.g., `task-42 - Add GraphQL resolver.md`)
- Project documentation is in **`backlog/docs/`**
- Project decisions are in **`backlog/decisions/`**

### 🔧 **ACTING** (How to change things)

- **All task operations MUST use the Backlog.md CLI tool**
- This ensures metadata is correctly updated and the project stays in sync
- **Always use `--plain` flag** when listing or viewing tasks for AI-friendly text output

---

## 2. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ **WRONG: Direct File Editing**

```markdown
# DON'T DO THIS:

1. Open backlog/tasks/task-7 - Feature.md in editor
2. Change "- [ ]" to "- [x]" manually
3. Add notes directly to the file
4. Save the file
```

### ✅ **CORRECT: Using CLI Commands**

```bash
# DO THIS INSTEAD:
backlog task edit 7 --check-ac 1  # Mark AC #1 as complete
backlog task edit 7 --notes "Implementation complete"  # Add notes
backlog task edit 7 -s "In Progress" -a @agent-k  # Multiple commands: change status and assign the task when you start working on the task
```

## 3. Understanding Task Format (Read-Only Reference)

⚠️ **FORMAT REFERENCE ONLY** - The following sections show what you'll SEE in task files.
**Never edit these directly! Use CLI commands to make changes.**

| Add Plan                | `backlog task edit 42 --plan "1. Step one\n2. Step two"` |
| Add Notes (replace)     | `backlog task edit 42 --notes "What I did"`              |
| Append Notes            | `backlog task edit 42 --append-notes "Another note"` |

---

## 4. Defining Tasks

### Creating New Tasks

**Always use CLI to create tasks:**

```bash
# Example
backlog task create "Task title" -d "Description" --ac "First criterion" --ac "Second criterion"
```

### Title (one liner)

Use a clear brief title that summarizes the task.

### Description (The "why")

Provide a concise summary of the task purpose and its goal. Explains the context without implementation details.

### Acceptance Criteria (The "what")

**Understanding the Format:**

- Acceptance criteria appear as numbered checkboxes in the markdown files
- Format: `- [ ] #1 Criterion text` (unchecked) or `- [x] #1 Criterion text` (checked)

**Managing Acceptance Criteria via CLI:**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: How AC Commands Work**

- **Adding criteria (`--ac`)** accepts multiple flags: `--ac "First" --ac "Second"` ✅
- **Checking/unchecking/removing** accept multiple flags too: `--check-ac 1 --check-ac 2` ✅
- **Mixed operations** work in a single command: `--check-ac 1 --uncheck-ac 2 --remove-ac 3` ✅

```bash
# Examples

# Add new criteria (MULTIPLE values allowed)
backlog task edit 42 --ac "User can login" --ac "Session persists"

# Check specific criteria by index (MULTIPLE values supported)
backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1 --check-ac 2 --check-ac 3  # Check multiple ACs
# Or check them individually if you prefer:
backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1    # Mark #1 as complete
backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 2    # Mark #2 as complete

# Mixed operations in single command
backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1 --uncheck-ac 2 --remove-ac 3

# ❌ STILL WRONG - These formats don't work:
# backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1,2,3  # No comma-separated values
# backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1-3    # No ranges
# backlog task edit 42 --check 1         # Wrong flag name

# Multiple operations of same type
backlog task edit 42 --uncheck-ac 1 --uncheck-ac 2  # Uncheck multiple ACs
backlog task edit 42 --remove-ac 2 --remove-ac 4    # Remove multiple ACs (processed high-to-low)
```

**Key Principles for Good ACs:**

- **Outcome-Oriented:** Focus on the result, not the method.
- **Testable/Verifiable:** Each criterion should be objectively testable
- **Clear and Concise:** Unambiguous language
- **Complete:** Collectively cover the task scope
- **User-Focused:** Frame from end-user or system behavior perspective

Good Examples:

- "User can successfully log in with valid credentials"
- "System processes 1000 requests per second without errors"
- "CLI preserves literal newlines in description/plan/notes; `\\n` sequences are not auto‑converted"

Bad Example (Implementation Step):

- "Add a new function handleLogin() in auth.ts"
- "Define expected behavior and document supported input patterns"

### Task Breakdown Strategy

1. Identify foundational components first
2. Create tasks in dependency order (foundations before features)
3. Ensure each task delivers value independently
4. Avoid creating tasks that block each other

### Task Requirements

- Tasks must be **atomic** and **testable** or **verifiable**
- Each task should represent a single unit of work for one PR
- **Never** reference future tasks (only tasks with id < current task id)
- Ensure tasks are **independent** and don't depend on future work

## 5. Implementing Tasks

### 5.1. First step when implementing a task

The very first things you must do when you take over a task are:

* set the task in progress
* assign it to yourself

```bash
# Example
backlog task edit 42 -s "In Progress" -a @{myself}
```

### 5.2. Create an Implementation Plan (The "how")

Previously created tasks contain the why and the what. Once you are familiar with that part you should think about a
plan on **HOW** to tackle the task and all its acceptance criteria. This is your **Implementation Plan**.
First do a quick check to see if all the tools that you are planning to use are available in the environment you are
working in.   
When you are ready, write it down in the task so that you can refer to it later.

```bash
# Example
backlog task edit 42 --plan "1. Research codebase for references\n2Research on internet for similar cases\n3. Implement\n4. Test"
```

## 5.3. Implementation

Once you have a plan, you can start implementing the task. This is where you write code, run tests, and make sure
everything works as expected. Follow the acceptance criteria one by one and MARK THEM AS COMPLETE as soon as you
finish them.

### 5.4 Implementation Notes (PR description)

When you are done implementing a tasks you need to prepare a PR description for it.
Because you cannot create PRs directly, write the PR as a clean description in the task notes.
Append notes progressively during implementation using `--append-notes`:

```
backlog task edit 42 --append-notes "Implemented X" --append-notes "Added tests"
```

```bash
# Example
backlog task edit 42 --notes "Implemented using pattern X because Reason Y, modified files Z and W"
```

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include an Implementation Plan when creating a task. The plan is added only after you start the
implementation.

- Creation phase: provide Title, Description, Acceptance Criteria, and optionally labels/priority/assignee.
- When you begin work, switch to edit, set the task in progress and assign to yourself
  `backlog task edit <id> -s "In Progress" -a "..."`.
- Think about how you would solve the task and add the plan: `backlog task edit <id> --plan "..."`.
- Add Implementation Notes only after completing the work: `backlog task edit <id> --notes "..."` (replace) or append progressively using `--append-notes`.

## Phase discipline: What goes where

- Creation: Title, Description, Acceptance Criteria, labels/priority/assignee.
- Implementation: Implementation Plan (after moving to In Progress and assigning to yourself).
- Wrap-up: Implementation Notes (Like a PR description), AC and Definition of Done checks.

**IMPORTANT**: Only implement what's in the Acceptance Criteria. If you need to do more, either:

1. Update the AC first: `backlog task edit 42 --ac "New requirement"`
2. Or create a new follow up task: `backlog task create "Additional feature"`

---

## 6. Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Identify work
backlog task list -s "To Do" --plain

# 2. Read task details
backlog task 42 --plain

# 3. Start work: assign yourself & change status
backlog task edit 42 -s "In Progress" -a @myself

# 4. Add implementation plan
backlog task edit 42 --plan "1. Analyze\n2. Refactor\n3. Test"

# 5. Work on the task (write code, test, etc.)

# 6. Mark acceptance criteria as complete (supports multiple in one command)
backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1 --check-ac 2 --check-ac 3  # Check all at once
# Or check them individually if preferred:
# backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 1
# backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 2
# backlog task edit 42 --check-ac 3

# 7. Add implementation notes (PR Description)
backlog task edit 42 --notes "Refactored using strategy pattern, updated tests"

# 8. Mark task as done
backlog task edit 42 -s Done
```

---

## 7. Definition of Done (DoD)

A task is **Done** only when **ALL** of the following are complete:

### ✅ Via CLI Commands:

1. **All acceptance criteria checked**: Use `backlog task edit <id> --check-ac <index>` for each
2. **Implementation notes added**: Use `backlog task edit <id> --notes "..."`
3. **Status set to Done**: Use `backlog task edit <id> -s Done`

### ✅ Via Code/Testing:

4. **Tests pass**: Run test suite and linting
5. **Documentation updated**: Update relevant docs if needed
6. **Code reviewed**: Self-review your changes
7. **No regressions**: Performance, security checks pass

⚠️ **NEVER mark a task as Done without completing ALL items above**

---

## 8. Finding Tasks and Content with Search

When users ask you to find tasks related to a topic, use the `backlog search` command with `--plain` flag:

```bash
# Search for tasks about authentication
backlog search "auth" --plain

# Search only in tasks (not docs/decisions)
backlog search "login" --type task --plain

# Search with filters
backlog search "api" --status "In Progress" --plain
backlog search "bug" --priority high --plain
```

**Key points:**
- Uses fuzzy matching - finds "authentication" when searching "auth"
- Searches task titles, descriptions, and content
- Also searches documents and decisions unless filtered with `--type task`
- Always use `--plain` flag for AI-readable output

### Multi‑line Input (Description/Plan/Notes)

The CLI preserves input literally. Shells do not convert `\n` inside normal quotes. Use one of the following to insert real newlines:

- Bash/Zsh (ANSI‑C quoting):
  - Description: `backlog task edit 42 --desc $'Line1\nLine2\n\nFinal'`
  - Plan: `backlog task edit 42 --plan $'1. A\n2. B'`
  - Notes: `backlog task edit 42 --notes $'Done A\nDoing B'`
  - Append notes: `backlog task edit 42 --append-notes $'Progress update line 1\nLine 2'`
- POSIX portable (printf):
  - `backlog task edit 42 --notes "$(printf 'Line1\nLine2')"`
- PowerShell (backtick n):
  - `backlog task edit 42 --notes "Line1`nLine2"`

Do not expect `"...\n..."` to become a newline. That passes the literal backslash + n to the CLI by design.

Descriptions support literal newlines; shell examples may show escaped `\\n`, but enter a single `\n` to create a newline.

### Implementation Notes Formatting

- Keep implementation notes human-friendly and PR-ready: use short paragraphs or
  bullet lists instead of a single long line.
- Lead with the outcome, then add supporting details (e.g., testing, follow-up
  actions) on separate lines or bullets.
- Prefer Markdown bullets (`-` for unordered, `1.` for ordered) so Maintainers
  can paste notes straight into GitHub without additional formatting.
- When using CLI flags like `--append-notes`, remember to include explicit
  newlines. Example:

  ```bash
  backlog task edit 42 --append-notes $'- Added new API endpoint\n- Updated tests\n- TODO: monitor staging deploy'
  ```

## Common Issues

| Problem              | Solution                                                           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Task not found       | Check task ID with `backlog task list --plain`                     |
| AC won't check       | Use correct index: `backlog task 42 --plain` to see AC numbers     |
| Changes not saving   | Ensure you're using CLI, not editing files                         |
| Metadata out of sync | Re-edit via CLI to fix: `backlog task edit 42 -s <current-status>` |

## Remember: The Golden Rule

**🎯 If you want to change ANYTHING in a task, use the `backlog task edit` command.**
**📖 Use CLI to read tasks, exceptionally READ task files directly, never WRITE to them.**
