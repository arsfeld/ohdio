## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The current navigation has 'Queue' as the main page, but it should be renamed to 'Home' since it serves as the main landing page with the download form and queue management. The navbar also needs cleanup to ensure consistent naming and better UX.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Main route '/' is labeled as 'Home' instead of 'Queue' in the navbar
- [ ] #2 Page title is updated from 'Download Queue' to 'Home' or appropriate alternative
- [ ] #3 All references to 'queue page' in code/UI are updated to 'home page' where appropriate
- [ ] #4 Navbar styling and layout is clean and consistent

<!-- AC:END -->
